# Business Understanding 
Businesses across the globe are revolutionizing how people travel and stay, with platforms like Airbnb leading the charge. By leveraging technology, Airbnb connects hosts with a diverse customer base, offering personalized travel experiences worldwide.

Customer segmentation plays a pivotal role in this ecosystem, categorizing users into distinct groups based on preferences, behaviors, and booking patterns.

This project focuses on identifying key customer segments within Airbnb’s platform to enhance user satisfaction, optimize marketing strategies, and drive growth in the competitive short-term rental market

# Problem Statement/ Description
Understanding Market Dynamics
The dataset provides a snapshot of Airbnb's listing activity in London, capturing trends in host engagement, guest preferences, and listing performance in 2022. By analyzing this data, we can uncover insights into the dynamics of the short-term rental market in one of the world’s most visited cities.

Optimizing Pricing Strategies
Hosts on Airbnb face the challenge of setting competitive prices while maximizing occupancy. This dataset offers an opportunity to analyze pricing patterns, identify factors influencing revenue, and recommend strategies for dynamic pricing.

Enhancing Guest Experience
With Airbnb’s focus on personalized travel, understanding guest preferences is critical. By exploring booking trends, property types, and guest reviews, we can identify ways to improve satisfaction and foster repeat bookings.

Identifying Popular Locations
Location plays a significant role in a listing’s success. By mapping the distribution of listings and their performance metrics, we can identify high-demand areas and help hosts optimize their listings for maximum visibility.

Boosting Host Engagement
The dataset allows us to examine host activity, including response rates and listing updates, providing insights into how hosts can improve their performance and better engage with potential guests.

Sustainability in Hosting
With an increasing focus on sustainable travel, this dataset enables the identification of environmentally friendly practices or trends among hosts, which could align with Airbnb’s broader mission for responsible tourism.

# Why the need for the analysis? / Inspiration

What can we learn about different hosts and areas?

What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)

Which hosts are the busiest and why?

Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?

## How to Run the Project
In order to run the project just download the data from above mentioned source then run any file.

## Prerequisites
You need to have installed following softwares and libraries in your machine before running this project.

Python 3

Anaconda: It will install ipython notebook and most of the libraries which are needed like sklearn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn.

# Key findings:
Westminster has the highest count of total listings at 82,350. Although a more popular destination, The City of London only has 2,562 listings.

Westminster has the most hosts registered at 4,276, the most out of all the neighborhoods.

The majority of hosts (24,681) have entire homes and/or apartments listed in London. Private rooms are made up of 19,993 hosts, with only 228 hosts listing hotels.

As you move closer to the center of London, the number of hosts generally increases. Only 215 registered hosts have listings in that area. Westminster has the highest number of listings, followed by Hackney and Tower Hamlets.

After reviewing the max and average prices in all neighborhoods, some listings were found to have a max price of 25,000 a night; whereas 31 of the 34 neighborhoods listed their properties at under 100 a night. Due to various price levels, the average price per listing was inconclusive.

The median price had a stronger representation of how much the actual prices were.

Hackney had the lowest availability listed out of all neighborhoods, with only 33 listings.

Westminster also has the median price of 140 a night, whereas the city of london has the median price listed at 150 a night.

# Recommendations
Having more units of type entier hoom with lower prices that compete with units of type private room will increase the usage of these units since people tend to use them even in with low budget.

Targeting cities closer to the centre of London like (Covent Garden, Fitzrovia, Soho, Leicester Square, Mayfair)

Lower the prices of the cities that are further away from London like (barnet, Hounslow, Richmond, Kingston)
In areas with high usage levels a marketing campaign should target the unit's owner, not the user to increase the number of units in these areas

In areas with low usage levels a marketing campaign should target the user, not the unit owner to increase the usage levels of the units in these areas

Making discounts or offers for people in the less used areas to encourage them to book through Airbnb

# KPIs that would make the analysis better and more reliable

A KPI for customer service should be added

A KPI for rooms quality should be added

A KPI for the review feedback should be added

A survey should be initialised all over London asking people about the most preferable and most bad to be avoided
